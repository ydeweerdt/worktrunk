Merge current branch into the target branch. Squash & rebase, fast-forward the target branch, remove the worktree.

Unlike `git merge`, this merges the current branch into the target branch — not the target into current. Similar to clicking "Merge pull request" on GitHub, but locally. The target defaults to the default branch.

## Examples

Merge to the default branch:

{% terminal(cmd="wt merge") %}

{% end %}

Merge to a different branch:

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge develop") }}

Keep the worktree after merging:

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge --no-remove") }}

Preserve commit history (no squash):

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge --no-squash") }}

Create a merge commit — rebased semi-linear history by default:

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge --no-ff") }}

Skip committing/squashing (rebase still runs unless --no-rebase):

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge --no-commit") }}

Preserve the exact clean commit graph and tip:

{{ terminal(cmd="wt merge --no-commit --no-rebase") }}

## Pipeline

`wt merge` runs these steps:

1. **Commit** — Pre-commit hooks run, then uncommitted changes are committed. Post-commit hooks run in background. Skipped when squashing (the default) — changes are staged during the squash step instead. With `--no-squash`, this is the only commit step.
2. **Squash** — Combines all commits since target into one (like GitHub's "Squash and merge"). Use `--stage` to control what gets staged: `all` (default), `tracked`, or `none`. Working-tree changes swept into the squash are backed up first to `refs/wt-backup/<branch>`. With `--no-squash`, individual commits are preserved.
3. **Rebase** — Rebases onto target, skipping when nothing needs replaying ([`wt step rebase`](@/step.md#wt-step-rebase) gives the conditions). A conflict stops the merge with the rebase left open in the worktree, to resolve or abort. With `--no-rebase`, the graph produced by earlier commit/squash steps is preserved and the target must be able to fast-forward to its tip.
4. **Pre-merge hooks** — Hooks run after rebase, before merge. Failures abort. See [`wt hook`](@/hook.md).
5. **Merge** — Fast-forward merge to the target branch ([`wt step push`](@/step.md#wt-step-push)). With `--no-ff`, a merge commit is created instead — semi-linear history after the default rebase, while explicit `--no-rebase` preserves the graph produced by earlier steps before adding the merge commit. Non-fast-forward merges are rejected.
6. **Pre-remove hooks** — Hooks run before removing worktree. Failures abort.
7. **Cleanup** — Removes the worktree and branch. Use `--no-remove` to keep the worktree. When already on the target branch or in the primary worktree, the worktree is preserved.
8. **Post-remove + post-merge hooks** — Run in background after cleanup.

Use `--no-commit` to skip committing uncommitted changes and squashing; rebase still runs by default and can rewrite commits unless `--no-rebase` is passed. Combining both flags preserves the exact source graph and requires the target to be its ancestor. Useful after preparing commits manually with `wt step commit`. Requires a clean working tree.

`wt merge` targets the *local* default-branch ref and never fetches. When that ref lags its upstream — e.g. a primary checkout's `main` left behind `origin/main` — a branch based on the newer upstream tip is measured, squashed, and rebased against the upstream (so already-upstream commits are never folded into the squash), and the final fast-forward carries the local ref through the already-fetched upstream commits by their real SHAs. `wt step squash` and `wt step rebase` measure the same way. A local target that has *diverged* from its upstream — its own commits and behind — cannot fast-forward, so the merge is refused until the target is reconciled.

## Local CI

For personal projects, pre-merge hooks open up the possibility of a workflow with much faster iteration — an order of magnitude more small changes instead of fewer large ones.

Historically, ensuring tests ran before merging was difficult to enforce locally. Remote CI was valuable for the process as much as the checks: it guaranteed validation happened. `wt merge` brings that guarantee local.

The full workflow: start an agent (one of many) on a task, work elsewhere, return when it's ready. Review the diff, run `wt merge`, move on. Pre-merge hooks validate before merging — if they pass, the branch goes to the default branch and the worktree cleans up.

```toml
[[pre-merge]]
test = "cargo test"
lint = "cargo clippy"
```

## Submodule management

When `--recurse-submodules` is set, `wt merge` checks each initialized
submodule for gitlink changes between the feature and target branches.
For each modified submodule, the target branch is checked out and the
feature branch is merged into it, keeping submodule history in sync
with the parent merge. A merge conflict in a submodule aborts the
parent merge with a hint for manual resolution.
