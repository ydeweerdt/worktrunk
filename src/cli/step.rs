## Options

### Staging

Controls what to stage before committing:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `all` | Stage all changes including untracked files (default) |
| `tracked` | Stage only modified tracked files |
| `none` | Don't stage anything, commit only what's already staged |

```console
$ wt step commit --stage=tracked
```

Configure the default in user config:

```toml
[commit]
stage = "tracked"
```

### Dry run

Render the prompt, print the LLM command, generate the message, and exit without staging, running hooks, or committing:

```console
$ wt step commit --dry-run
```

Three sections are printed: the rendered prompt, the shell command that would invoke the LLM, and the message returned. The LLM call still happens — only the commit is skipped.

    /// Rebase onto target
    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"A rebase puts the branch's commits on top of the target, which is what [`wt step push`](#wt-step-push) needs — a push fast-forwards only if the target is an ancestor of the branch. `wt merge` runs this step as part of its pipeline; on its own it brings a branch up to date with a target that has moved, without merging into it.

The target is any commit: a branch, a tag, a SHA.

## Examples

```console
$ wt step rebase            # Rebase onto default branch
$ wt step rebase develop    # Rebase onto develop
$ wt step rebase v1.2.0     # Rebase onto a tag
```

## Outcomes

The first matching row wins:

| Branch and target | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| The target is already an ancestor of the branch, with no merge commit in between | Nothing runs — `Already up to date` |
| The branch is an ancestor of the target, so it has no commits of its own | `Fast-forwarded to <target>` |
| Otherwise | The branch's commits replay onto the target's tip — refused outright if the two share no history |

A branch that merged the target into itself still rebases: the target is its ancestor, but the merge commit in between keeps the first row from applying.

When the target's local ref lags its upstream, the rows are measured against that upstream, which the result then names in place of the argument. [`wt merge`](@/merge.md) covers why.

## Conflicts

A conflicting commit leaves the rebase open rather than undoing it. The worktree keeps git's conflict markers, and the ways out are `git rebase --continue` once the conflict is resolved, `git rebase --skip`, or `git rebase --abort`. Until the rebase is settled, `wt step rebase`, `wt step squash`, `wt step push`, and `wt merge` refuse to run — as they do while any other git operation is open, a conflicted `git merge` included.

    /// Fast-forward target to current branch
    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Despite the name, no commits leave the repository. The target branch's ref moves forward locally, and a worktree holding that branch is updated along with it. Publishing is a separate `git push` to the remote afterward.

The target is a branch, and must already be an ancestor of the current branch. One that has moved ahead is refused, and there is no force variant — [`wt step rebase`](#wt-step-rebase) puts the branch back on top of it first.

## Examples

```console
$ wt step push                          # Fast-forward main to current branch
$ wt step push develop                  # Fast-forward develop instead
$ wt step push --no-ff                  # Merge commit instead of a fast-forward
$ wt step push --recurse-submodules=yes # Also push submodule changes
```

## Target worktree

When the target branch has a worktree of its own, that worktree's files move to the new commits too. A fast-forward does both at once, pushing into this repository with `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`; `--no-ff` moves the ref first and syncs the worktree after, warning rather than failing if that sync doesn't apply. Uncommitted changes in that worktree are stashed for the duration and restored afterward; one touching a file the push also changes is refused instead, naming the file.

A worktree that is still registered but whose directory is gone is refused as well, since nothing can be synced into it — `git worktree prune` clears the registration.

Submodule pushing is disabled by default. Pass `--recurse-submodules=yes` or `--recurse-submodules=check` to enable.

## Operating on another worktree

`--branch` diffs another worktree's branch without leaving the current one:

```console
$ wt step diff --branch feature
```

The branch must have a checked-out worktree.

## Extra git diff arguments

Arguments after `--` are forwarded to `git diff`:

```console
$ wt step diff -- --stat
$ wt step diff -- --name-only
$ wt step diff -- -- '*.rs'
```

The diff is pipeable to tools like `delta`:

```console
$ wt step diff | delta
```

## How it works

Equivalent to:

```console
$ cp "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/index" /tmp/idx
$ GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git add --intent-to-add .
$ GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git diff $(git merge-base HEAD $(wt config state default-branch))
```

`git diff` ignores untracked files. `git add --intent-to-add .` registers them in the index without staging their content, making them visible to `git diff`. This runs against a copy of the real index so the original is never modified.

    /// Copy gitignored files to another worktree
    ///
    /// Eliminates cold starts by copying build caches and dependencies.
    #[command(after_long_help = r#"## Setup

Add to the project config:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

## What gets copied

All gitignored files are copied by default, except for built-in excluded directories: VCS metadata (`.bzr/`, `.hg/`, `.jj/`, `.pijul/`, `.sl/`, `.svn/`), tool-state (`.conductor/`, `.entire/`, `.worktrees/`), and nested worktrees. Tracked files are never touched. Discovery handles nested `.gitignore` files, global excludes, and `.git/info/exclude`. Existing files in the destination are skipped, so re-running is safe; `--force` overwrites them.

To limit what gets copied further, create `.worktreeinclude` with gitignore-style patterns. Files must be **both** gitignored **and** in `.worktreeinclude`:

```text
# .worktreeinclude
.env
node_modules/
target/
```

After `.worktreeinclude` selects entries, you can add more gitignore-style excludes in user config, per-project user overrides, or project config:

```toml
[step.copy-ignored]
exclude = [".cache/", ".turbo/"]
```

To copy nothing unless `.worktreeinclude` exists — matching Claude Code desktop, where the file is required — pass `--require-include`:

```console
wt step copy-ignored --require-include
```

Without `.worktreeinclude`, the command is a no-op (it reports that nothing was copied and why). With the file present, only matching files copy as above. To apply this across every repository, put the flag in a user-config hook: `post-start = "wt step copy-ignored --require-include"`.

## Common patterns

| Type | Patterns |
|------|----------|
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `Pods/` |
| Build caches | `.cache/`, `.next/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/` |
| Generated assets | Images, ML models, binaries too large for git |
| Environment files | `.env` (if not generated per-worktree) |

## Performance

Reflink copies share disk blocks until modified — no data is actually copied. For a 14GB `target/` directory:

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `cp -R` (full copy) | 2m |
| `cp -Rc` / `wt step copy-ignored` | 20s |

Uses per-file reflink (like `cp -Rc`) — copy time scales with file count.

Use the `post-start` hook so the copy runs in the background. Use `pre-start` instead if subsequent hooks or `--execute` command need the copied files immediately.

## Background-hook priority (experimental)

When invoked from a background hook pipeline (`post-*` hooks), `wt step copy-ignored` self-lowers its CPU and I/O priority — `taskpolicy -b` on macOS, `nice -n 19` plus `ionice -c 3` on Linux — so it yields to interactive work. Foreground callers (`pre-*` hooks, direct interactive use) run at normal priority so the user isn't waiting on a throttled copy.

wt signals background-hook context by exporting `WORKTRUNK_FOREGROUND=-1` into every detached hook pipeline; `copy-ignored` inspects that variable on entry. The variable name is experimental and may change.

## Language-specific notes

### Rust

The `target/` directory is huge (often 1-10GB). Copying with reflink cuts first build from ~68s to ~3s by reusing compiled dependencies.

### Node.js

`node_modules/` is large but mostly static. If the project has no native dependencies, symlinks are even faster:

```toml
[pre-start]
deps = "ln -sf {{ primary_worktree_path }}/node_modules ."
```

### Python

Virtual environments contain absolute paths and can't be copied. Use `uv sync` instead — it's fast enough that copying isn't worth it.

## Behavior vs Claude Code on desktop

The `.worktreeinclude` pattern is shared with [Claude Code on desktop](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), which copies matching files when creating worktrees. Differences:

- worktrunk copies all gitignored files by default; Claude Code requires `.worktreeinclude`. Pass `--require-include` to match Claude Code (copy nothing without `.worktreeinclude`)
- worktrunk uses copy-on-write for large directories like `target/` (see Performance above)
- worktrunk runs as a configurable hook in the worktree lifecycle

A template-expansion error (a malformed `{{ … }}` argument) aborts the whole run; only command failures are tolerated and reported. Context JSON — a flat object of every template variable — is piped to stdin for scripts that need structured data.

## Arguments

Arguments after `--` are the program and its arguments — run directly, no shell.

```console
$ wt step for-each -- git status --short
$ wt step for-each -- npm install
```

For pipes, redirects, variables, or globs, wrap in `sh -c`:

```console
$ wt step for-each -- sh -c 'git status | wc -l'
$ wt step for-each -- sh -c 'echo $HOME && git pull'
```

## Template variables

Variables substitute into each argv element before exec. See [`wt hook` template variables](@/hook.md#template-variables) for the complete list and filters.

```console
$ wt step for-each -- echo 'Branch: {{ branch }}'
```

Each element is expanded fresh in every worktree, so `{{ branch }}` is that worktree's branch. An alias wrapping for-each renders templates earlier, in the invoking worktree; [deferring expansion in an alias](@/extending.md#deferring-expansion-to-a-nested-wt-command) shows how to keep a variable per-worktree.

## Examples

Pull updates in worktrees with upstreams (skips others):

```console
$ git fetch --prune && wt step for-each -- sh -c '[ "$(git rev-parse @{u} 2>/dev/null)" ] || exit 0; git pull --autostash'
```

        args: Vec<String>,
    },

    /// \[experimental\] Swap a branch into the main worktree

    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"**Experimental.** Use promote for temporary testing when the main worktree has special significance (Docker Compose, IDE configs, heavy build artifacts anchored to project root), and hooks & tools aren't yet set up to run on arbitrary worktrees. The idiomatic Worktrunk workflow does not use `promote`; instead each worktree has a full environment. `promote` is the only Worktrunk command which changes a branch in an existing worktree.

## Example

```console
# from ~/project (main worktree)
$ wt step promote feature
```

Before:

```
  Branch   Path
@ main     ~/project
+ feature  ~/project.feature
```

After:

```
  Branch   Path
@ feature  ~/project
+ main     ~/project.feature
```

To restore: `wt step promote main` from anywhere, or just `wt step promote` from the main worktree.

Without an argument, promotes the current branch — or restores the default branch if run from the main worktree.

## Requirements

- Both worktrees must be clean
- The branch must have an existing worktree

## Gitignored files

Gitignored files (build artifacts, `node_modules/`, `.env`) are swapped along with the branches so each worktree keeps the artifacts that belong to its branch. Files are discovered using the same mechanism as [`copy-ignored`](#wt-step-copy-ignored) and can be filtered with `.worktreeinclude`.

The swap uses `rename()` for each entry — fast regardless of entry size, since only filesystem metadata changes. If the worktree is on a different filesystem from `.git/`, it falls back to reflink copy.

In `wt list`, candidates show `_` (same commit) or `⊂` (content integrated). Run `--dry-run` to preview. See `wt remove --help` for the full integration criteria.

Locked worktrees and the main worktree are always skipped. The current worktree is removed last, triggering cd to the primary worktree. Pre-remove and post-remove hooks run for each removal; a candidate whose hooks include an unapproved project command is skipped with `(approval required)` (pre-approve with `wt config approvals add`, or pass `--yes`).

## Min-age guard

Worktrees younger than `--min-age` (default: 1 day) are skipped. This prevents removing a worktree just created from the default branch — it looks "merged" because its branch points at the same commit.

```console
$ wt step prune --min-age=0s     # no age guard

Auto-commit and clobber blockers (never fails):

## Swap handling

When worktrees are at each other's expected locations (e.g., `alpha` at
`repo.beta` and `beta` at `repo.alpha`), relocate automatically resolves
this by using a temporary location.

## Clobbering

With `--clobber`, non-worktree paths at target locations are moved to
`<path>.bak.<timestamp>` before relocating. If that name is already taken,
the move counts up (`…-2`, `…-3`, …) until it finds a free name, so an
existing backup is never overwritten.

## Main worktree behavior

The main worktree can't be moved with `git worktree move`. Instead, relocate
switches it to the default branch and creates a new linked worktree at the
expected path. Untracked and gitignored files remain at the original location.

## Dirty worktrees

Linked worktrees relocate as-is — `git worktree move` carries uncommitted
changes along. Only the main worktree skips when dirty (its `git checkout`
refuses), unless `--commit` is passed.

## Skipped worktrees

- **Dirty main worktree** (without `--commit`) — use `--commit` to auto-commit first
- **Locked** — unlock with `git worktree unlock`
- **Target blocked** (without `--clobber`) — use `--clobber` to backup blocker
- **Detached HEAD** — no branch to compute expected path

    /// Teardown is automatic and needs no `pre-remove` hook; the group gets `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL`.
    #[command(after_long_help = r#"## Why

A `post-start` hook to start a long-lived process and a `pre-remove` hook to
stop it is usually enough. But `pre-remove` only runs when worktrunk removes
the worktree, so a `git worktree remove`, an `rm -rf`, or a crashed hook skips
it. Across enough worktree churn some process is bound to outlive its worktree,
and with no cleanup these leaks accumulate (on macOS they eventually saturate
`fseventsd`). `tether` removes the need for a `pre-remove`: it ties the
command's lifetime to the worktree and kills the whole process group once the
worktree is gone.

## Arguments

Arguments after `--` are the program and its arguments, run directly, no shell.

```console
$ wt step tether -- npm run dev
```

For pipes, redirects, variables, or globs, wrap in `sh -c`:

```console
$ wt step tether -- sh -c 'PORT=$P npm run dev | tee dev.log'
```

To run the command from a subdirectory, pass the global `-C` flag (teardown
still watches the worktree root, so a server launched with a relative `-C` is
torn down with the worktree):

```console
$ wt step tether -C frontend -- npm run dev
```

## Examples

Run a dev server, torn down automatically when the worktree goes away:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
server = "wt step tether -- npm run dev -- --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```
