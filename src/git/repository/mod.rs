//! Repository - git repository operations.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Repository`] type for interacting with git repositories,
//! [`WorkingTree`] for worktree-specific operations, and [`Branch`] for branch-specific
//! operations.
//!
//! # Module organization
//!
//! - `mod.rs` - Core types and construction
//! - `working_tree.rs` - WorkingTree struct and worktree-specific operations
//! - `branch.rs` - Branch struct and single-branch operations (exists, upstream, remotes)
//! - `branches.rs` - Multi-branch operations (listing, filtering, completions)
//! - `worktrees.rs` - Worktree management (list, resolve, remove)
//! - `remotes.rs` - Remote and URL operations
//! - `diff.rs` - Diff, history, and commit operations
//! - `config.rs` - Git config, hints, markers, and default branch detection
//! - `integration.rs` - Integration detection (same commit, ancestor, trees match)
//!
//! # Caching
//!
//! Most repository data — remote URLs, config, default branch, merge-bases — is stable
//! for the duration of a single CLI command. [`RepoCache`] exploits this by caching
//! read-only values so repeated queries hit memory instead of spawning git processes.
//!
//! **Two layers, two scopes.** Cached state lives in either of:
//! - `RepoCache` — per-`Repository::at()` instance. Most repo-wide values
//!   (config, branches, worktree inventory) live here.
//! - Process-wide statics that survive across `RepoCache` instances:
//!   - `WORKTREE_ROOTS`, `GIT_DIRS`, `CURRENT_BRANCHES` (`LazyLock<DashMap>`),
//!     keyed by canonicalized worktree path, so two `Repository` instances
//!     pointed at the same path see the same answer.
//!   - `GIT_COMMON_DIR_CACHE` and `GIT_CONFIG_PRELOAD` (`LazyLock<DashMap>`),
//!     keyed by the *raw* discovery path passed to [`Repository::at`] /
//!     [`Repository::prewarm`] — not canonicalized, since both the prewarm
//!     producer and the `at()` consumer go through `base_path()` and share the
//!     same `PathBuf`.
//!   - `WORKTRUNK_USER_CONFIG_PRELOAD` (`OnceLock<UserConfig>`), process-scoped
//!     rather than path-keyed (the config-path rule is process-invariant).
//!
//!   This lets [`Repository::prewarm`] populate the maps once at the start
//!   of `main` and have every later `Repository::current()` (each builds a
//!   fresh `RepoCache`) reuse the result.
//!
//! **Persistence: in-memory vs on-disk.** Both layers above are in-memory and
//! die with the process. A third store — the persistent on-disk [`sha_cache`]
//! (SHA-keyed JSON under `.git/wt/cache/`) — survives across invocations.
//! Which store a git result belongs in turns on recompute cost and parallelism:
//! - *Cheap per call, but primeable in bulk* (commit→tree) → in-memory
//!   `RepoCache` `DashMap`, get-or-create. The `Entry` match holds the shard
//!   lock across check-and-insert, so parallel `wt list` rows sharing a key
//!   spawn one git process, not one each. On the `wt list` path the per-row
//!   lookups never fork at all: the pre-skeleton commit-details `git log`
//!   batch reads `%T` and primes this map in one round trip
//!   ([`Repository::commit_details_many`]), so cross-run disk persistence
//!   would save only the rare off-batch miss. Exemplar:
//!   [`Repository::commit_to_tree_sha`].
//! - *Expensive, worth persisting across invocations* (merge-tree, patch-id,
//!   diff stats, ahead/behind) → the disk [`sha_cache`]; content-addressed by
//!   SHA, so never stale.
//! - *Both expensive and hot-in-parallel* → an in-memory `DashMap` front over
//!   the disk back, so parallel tasks don't race through the file cache for the
//!   same key (the in-memory layer pays the first miss once; the disk layer
//!   persists it). Exemplars: the `diff_stats` field below, and
//!   [`Repository::merge_base_by_sha`] — `wt list`'s orphan check forks
//!   `merge-base` once per row even when the ahead/behind counts are already
//!   cache-warm, so without the disk back every re-run re-pays N forks; per-row
//!   recompute also runs 10–25 ms on macOS, not the ~1 ms a fast Linux box
//!   sees.
//!
//! **Lifetime.** Neither in-memory layer is ever invalidated. `RepoCache` lives as
//! long as the `Repository` it's attached to (typically the command).
//! Process-wide statics live for the process. For the CLI that's the same
//! thing — one command per process — but tests run many commands in one
//! process, so they may observe state from prior test cases (in practice
//! safe: tests use unique tempdir paths, and the maps are filesystem-keyed).
//!
//! **Sharing.** `Repository` holds an `Arc<RepoCache>`, so cloning a `Repository`
//! (e.g., to pass into parallel worktree operations in `wt list`) shares the same
//! cache. Callers that need a *separate* cache must call `Repository::at()` again
//! — but the process-wide maps are still shared in either case.
//!
//! **What is NOT cached.** Values that change during command execution are intentionally
//! excluded:
//! - `WorkingTree::is_dirty()` — changes as we stage and commit
//! - `WorkingTree::head_sha()` — HEAD moves on commit, rebase, or merge; a stale SHA
//!   would surface in template variables (`{{ commit }}`) for hooks that fire after the move
//!
//! [`Repository::list_worktrees`] is cached despite mutating commands adding or
//! removing worktrees. The cache is safe because no caller reads the list
//! through the same `Repository` after its own mutation — mutating paths
//! either read once up front and thread the slice through, or rebuild a
//! fresh `Repository::at(...)` before any post-mutation probe. This mirrors
//! the invariant the branch inventories already rely on.
//!
//! **Access patterns.** See the [`RepoCache`] doc comment for the two storage patterns
//! (repo-wide `OnceCell` vs per-key `DashMap`) and their infallible/fallible variants.
//!
//! **Invariants:**
//! - A cached value, once written, is never updated within the same command —
//!   with one exception: the `all_config` map is an `OnceCell<RwLock<..>>` whose
//!   *contents* stay coherent with in-process writes via
//!   [`Repository::set_config_value`]. The `OnceCell` slot is still written
//!   once; only the config values it holds can change.
//! - Cache access is lock-free at the call site for the `OnceCell`/`DashMap`
//!   caches, which handle synchronization internally. The one exception is
//!   `all_config`, whose `RwLock` callers lock explicitly (e.g. `config_last`)
//!   so config writes stay visible to later reads.
//! - Code that mutates repository state (committing, creating worktrees) must not read
//!   its own mutations through the cache. Use direct git commands for post-mutation
//!   state.
//!
//! **Other process-level singletons.** Outside `RepoCache` and the
//! git-discovery caches above, several modules use `OnceLock`/`LazyLock` for
//! process-global singletons that are *lazy initialization, not caches* —
//! the container is initialized once and never replaced, with no underlying
//! external state that could go stale:
//! - Resource limiters: `CMD_SEMAPHORE` (shell_exec), `HEAVY_OPS_SEMAPHORE` (git),
//!   `LLM_SEMAPHORE` (summary), `COPY_POOL` (copy)
//! - Global state: `OUTPUT_STATE` (output), `TRACE` and `SUBPROCESS` (log_files), `COMMAND_LOG`
//! - Config: `CONFIG_PATH` (config/user/path), `SHELL_CONFIG`, `GIT_ENV_OVERRIDES` (shell_exec)
//!
//! The picker also maintains a `PreviewCache` (`Arc<DashMap>` in `commands/picker/items.rs`)
//! for rendered preview output, scoped to a single picker session.
