//! Worktree removal with fast-path trash staging and safe branch deletion.
//!
//! This is the canonical removal flow used by `wt remove`, `wt merge --remove`,
//! and the TUI picker. External tooling (e.g. `worktrunk-sync`) can call it via
//! [`remove_worktree_with_cleanup`] to get the same semantics without
//! reimplementing the fsmonitor cleanup, trash-path staging, and
//! integration-check branch deletion.
//!
//! # What happens during removal
//!
//! 1. **Clean check** (skipped with [`RemoveOptions::force_worktree`]). The
//!    final dirty-worktree gate, immediately before the mutation. It runs
//!    while the fsmonitor daemon is still up, so the daemon serves the status
//!    instead of the stop below forcing a full re-stat.
//! 2. **fsmonitor daemon stopped** (best effort). [`stop_fsmonitor_daemon`]
//!    runs against the target worktree before its path disappears: it sends
//!    the graceful `git fsmonitor--daemon stop` IPC request, then verifies the
//!    daemon is actually gone and force-kills it by PID if it has wedged.
//!    Without this, a daemon that has stopped answering its socket leaks
//!    forever once its worktree is removed.
//! 3. **Fast-path trash staging.** The worktree directory is renamed into
//!    `<git-common-dir>/wt/trash/<name>-<timestamp>/`. Same-filesystem renames
//!    are instant metadata operations, so the user's workspace clears
//!    immediately. The caller is responsible for eventually removing the
//!    staged path — either synchronously or via a background process.
//! 4. **Fallback removal.** If the rename fails (cross-filesystem, permission
//!    denied, Windows file locks), the code falls back to `git worktree remove`
//!    (optionally with `--force`), which deletes files directly.
//! 5. **Branch deletion** (optional). When a branch name is supplied, the
//!    branch is deleted according to the requested [`BranchDeletionMode`]:
//!    - [`Keep`](BranchDeletionMode::Keep): never delete.
//!    - [`SafeDelete`](BranchDeletionMode::SafeDelete): delete only if
//!      [`Repository::integration_reason`] reports the branch as integrated
//!      into `target_branch` (or `HEAD` when unspecified).
//!    - [`ForceDelete`](BranchDeletionMode::ForceDelete): run `branch -D`
//!      without the integration check.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::path::Path;
//! use worktrunk::git::{
//!     BranchDeletionMode, RemoveOptions, Repository, remove_worktree_with_cleanup,
//! };
//!
//! let repo = Repository::current()?;
//! let snapshot = repo.capture_refs()?;
//! let output = remove_worktree_with_cleanup(
//!     &repo,
//!     &snapshot,
//!     Path::new("/repos/myproject.feature"),
//!     RemoveOptions {
//!         branch: Some("feature".into()),
//!         deletion_mode: BranchDeletionMode::SafeDelete,
//!         target_branch: Some("main".into()),
//!         force_worktree: false,
//!     },
//! )?;
//!
//! // Caller cleans up the staged trash entry (sync or background).
//! if let Some(staged) = output.staged_path {
//!     let _ = std::fs::remove_dir_all(staged);
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
