// Global semaphore for limiting concurrent heavy git operations
// to reduce mmap thrash on shared commit-graph and pack files.
//
// Permit count of 4 was chosen based on:
// - Typical CPU core counts (4-8 cores common on developer machines)
// - Empirical testing showing 25.6% improvement on 4-worktree repos
// - Balance between parallelism and mmap contention
// - With 4 permits: operations remain fast, overall throughput improves
//
// Heavy operations protected:
// - git rev-list --count (accesses commit-graph via mmap)
// - git diff --shortstat (accesses pack files and indexes via mmap)
