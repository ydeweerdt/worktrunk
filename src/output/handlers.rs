/// # Shell Integration Warnings
///
/// Always warn when the shell's directory won't change. Users expect to be in
/// the target worktree after switching.
///
/// **When to warn:** Shell integration is not active (no directive files set).
/// This applies to both `Existing` and `Created` results.
///
/// **When NOT to warn:**
/// - `AlreadyAt` — user is already in the target directory
/// - Shell integration IS active — cd will happen automatically
///
/// **Warning format:** `Cannot change directory — {reason}`
///
/// See [`compute_shell_warning_reason`] for the full list of reasons.
///
/// **Message order for Created:** Success message first, then warning. Creation
/// is a real accomplishment, but users still need to know they won't cd there.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `change_dir` — When false, skip the directory change (user requested `--no-cd`)
///
/// # Return Value
///
/// Returns `Some(path)` when post-switch hooks should show "@ path" in their
/// announcements (because the user's shell won't be in that directory). This happens when:
/// - Shell integration is not active (user's shell stays in original directory)
/// - `change_dir` is false (user explicitly requested no directory change)
///
/// Returns `None` when the user will be in the worktree directory (shell integration
/// active or already at the worktree), so no path annotation needed.

/// Run a shell command with streaming output, signal forwarding, and ANSI reset.
///
/// Entry point for foreground hook and alias execution. `wt step for-each`
/// (`for_each.rs`, direct argv exec with no shell) and the background
/// pipeline runner (`run_pipeline.rs`, redirects to log files and runs
/// detached) have their own spawning logic.
///
/// Capabilities: optional stdout→stderr redirect for deterministic ordering,
/// SIGINT/SIGTERM forwarding to child process group, ANSI reset before child
/// runs, `Cmd` tracing/logging, and directive file control.
///
/// ## Directive files
///
/// `directives` controls whether the child can write shell-integration
/// directives back to the parent shell. The CD file is always safe to pass
/// through (raw path, no injection surface); the EXEC file is normally scrubbed
/// because alias/hook bodies must not inject arbitrary shell into the parent
/// session — see [`DirectivePassthrough::inherit_from_env_with_exec`] for the
/// one exception.
///
/// - `DirectivePassthrough::default()` — scrubs all directive env vars from
///   the child. Used by background hooks (outlive the parent shell).
/// - `DirectivePassthrough::inherit_from_env()` — re-adds CD but scrubs EXEC.
///   Used by project aliases and foreground hooks, which may emit `cd`
///   directives but must not be able to inject shell.
/// - `DirectivePassthrough::inherit_from_env_with_exec()` — also re-adds EXEC.
///   Used only for user-source aliases, where the alias body is already user-
///   authored just like a top-level `wt switch --execute` invocation.
///
/// ## Stdout routing
///
/// `redirect_stdout_to_stderr` controls whether the child's stdout is merged
/// onto wt's stderr (`true`) or passed through unchanged (`false`).
///
/// - Hooks and `for-each` pass `true`: their output is decoration around
///   wt's own stderr messages, and merging keeps "Running …" / progress lines
///   ordered with the child's own writes.
/// - Aliases pass `false`: `wt <alias>` is a user-defined command and its
///   stdout must remain pipeable, so `wt my-alias | jq` and similar
///   compositions work (#2478).
///
/// ## ANSI reset
///
/// Resets ANSI codes on stderr before the child runs. Terminal emulators
/// maintain a single rendering state machine — if stdout writes color codes
/// but stderr's output arrives next, the terminal applies stdout's color
/// state to stderr's text. The reset to stderr prevents this.
///
/// ## Git discovery
///
/// `scrub_git_discovery` removes inherited `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` (and the
/// rest of [`INHERITED_GIT_PATH_VARS`]) from the child so its `git` commands
/// discover the repo from `working_dir`. Hooks pass `true` (they operate on the
/// worktree wt targets); aliases pass `false` (they keep wt's inherited context,
/// like a top-level command the user typed). See issue #3373.
